# Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree Project 3: Classic Arcade Game #
===============================

I created a HTML5 Canvas powered video game, developed using the best practices in Object Oriented JavaScript.

## RUN GAME ## 
* Visit (http://gabegonzales.co/frogger/) or
* Download or clone project from github and open index.html

## INSTRUCTIONS ## 
Use the arrow keys to reach the water. If you touch a monster you will go back to the beginning. If you are eaten 3x, the game is over and you can reset. If you reach the water once, you win the game. There is a specific built in strategy in order to reach the water easier. (HINT: Ghosts dissapear in real life as well as in arcade games).   Good Luck!

===============================

Students should use this [rubric](https://review.udacity.com/#!/projects/2696458597/rubric) for self-checking their submission. Make sure the functions you write are **object-oriented** - either class functions (like Player and Enemy) or class prototype functions such as Enemy.prototype.checkCollisions, and that the keyword 'this' is used appropriately within your class and class prototype functions to refer to the object the function is called upon. Also be sure that the **readme.md** file is updated with your instructions on both how to 1. Run and 2. Play your arcade game.

For detailed instructions on how to get started, check out this [guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1v01aScPjSWCCWQLIpFqvg3-vXLH2e8_SZQKC8jNO0Dc/pub?embedded=true).


1. RUN GAME: Visit (http://gabegonzales.co/frogger/)

2: INSTRUCTIONS: Use the arrow keys to reach the water. If you touch a monster you will go back to the beginning. If you are eaten 3x, the game is over and you can reset. If you reach the water once, you win the game. There is a specific built in strategy in order to reach the water easier. (HINT: Ghosts dissapear in real life as well as in arcade games).   Good Luck!
